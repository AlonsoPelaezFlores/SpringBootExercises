1) SpringBootWithPostgreSQL:
   Creation of a restful employee api with basic crud operations to test the connection to the postgres database in spring boot.
   We have used the Layer pattern for the package structure, Lombok annotations for the creation of constructors, getters and setters. 
   In addition to using dependency injections following the inversion of control (IoC) principle for the subsequent use of the repository 
   created for the crud operations inside the controller class.)
2) LibraryManagementSystem:
   Basic management system for a bookstore with books and authors using entity relationships to reference each author of a book and number 
   of books per author. Also using this time H2 as database and JpaRepository for the repository. Also the creation of an Api with basic 
   crud functions.
