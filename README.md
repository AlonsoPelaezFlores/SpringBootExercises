1) SpringBootWithPostgreSQL: Creation of a restful employee api with basic crud operations to test the connection to the postgres database in spring boot.
                             We have used the Layer pattern for the package structure, Lombok annotations for the creation of constructors, getters and setters. 
                             In addition to using dependency injections following the inversion of control (IoC) principle for the subsequent use of the repository 
                             created for the crud operations inside the controller class.
